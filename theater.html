        <h2>Uncle Vanya Act 4 by Anton Chekov</h2>
        <h5>ACT IV</h5>
        <h6>ASTROFF.</h6><p>Yes, sir, I did kiss her; so there.</p><p>[He puts his thumb to hisnose.]</p>
        <h6>VOITSKI.</h6><p>[His eyes on the door]</p><p>No, it is the earth that is mad, because she still bears us on her breast.</p>
        <h6>ASTROFF.</h6><p>That is nonsense.</p>
        <h6>VOITSKI.</h6><p>Well? Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible? Haven't I the right to talk nonsense?</p> 
        <h6>ASTROFF.</h6><p>This is a farce! You are not mad; you are simply a ridiculous fool. I used to think every fool was out of his senses, but now I
        see that lack of sense is a man's normal state, and you are perfectly normal.</p> 
        <h6>VOITSKI.</h6><p>[Covers his face with his hands]</p><p>Oh! If you knew how ashamed I am! These piercing pangs of shame are like nothing on earth.</p>  
        <p>[In anagonised voice]</p><p>I can't endure them!</p><p>[He leans against the table]</p><p>What can I do? What can I do?</p>  
        <h6>ASTROFF.</h6><p>Nothing.</p>
