        <h2>Uncle Vanya Act 4 by Anton Chekov</h2>
        <pre>ACT IV
        ASTROFF. Yes, sir, I did kiss her; so there. [He puts his thumb to hisnose.]
        VOITSKI. [His eyes on the door] No, it is the earth that is mad, because she still bears us on her breast.
        ASTROFF. That is nonsense.
        VOITSKI. Well? Am I not a madman, and therefore irresponsible? Haven't I the right to talk nonsense?
        ASTROFF. This is a farce! You are not mad; you are simply a ridiculous fool. I used to think every fool was out of his senses, but now I
        see that lack of sense is a man's normal state, and you are perfectly normal.
        VOITSKI. [Covers his face with his hands] Oh! If you knew how ashamed
        I am! These piercing pangs of shame are like nothing on earth. [In an
        agonised voice] I can't endure them! [He leans against the table] What
        can I do? What can I do?
        ASTROFF. Nothing.</pre>
