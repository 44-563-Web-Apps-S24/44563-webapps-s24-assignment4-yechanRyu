        old. I may live to sixty; I still have thirteen years before me; an
        eternity! How shall I be able to endure life for thirteen years?
        What shall I do? How can I fill them? Oh, don't you see?</p><p class="dirction">[He presses
        ASTROFF'S hand convulsively]</p><p class="speech">Don't you see, if only I could live the
        rest of my life in some new way! If I could only wake some still, bright
        morning and feel that life had begun again; that the past was forgotten
        and had vanished like smoke.</p><p class="dirction">[He weeps]</p><p class="speech">Oh, to begin life anew! Tell me,
